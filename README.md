# AimWare-Utils
Some LUA AimWare Utilities made by me

Installation:
  1.  Download 'xprtnwork_launcher.lua'
  2.  Create a folder called 'xprtnwork' (without ') and place the lua inside
  3.  In CS:GO, load the lua

I prefer adding the launcher to the autorun.lua to enable checking for updates on every startup.
